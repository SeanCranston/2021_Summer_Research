# 2021_Summer_Research


This undergraduate research project was conducted by Sean Cranston under the supervision
of Dr. Mengshi Zhou at St. Cloud State University. After deciding to do our study on
Movie Recommenders we looked at many different articles on the topic. Next we began to study
the r packages manuals. In particular, we spent a great deal of time studying the recommenderlab
package. Through the different articles we explored how to preprocess data, visualize data, 
fit many models, hyperparameter
 optimization, cross-validation, model comparison, ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, 
 and compare with random selection. 
 furthermore, we deployed a shiny app to where you can add data (rate some movies)
 and play with the different times of models (only the best models).

This project was a fun challenge and I am grateful for Dr. Zhou's guidance
