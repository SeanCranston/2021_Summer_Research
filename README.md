# 2021_Summer_Research


This undergraduate research project was conducted by Sean Cranston under the supervision
of Dr. Mengshi Zhou at St. Cloud State University. After deciding to do our study on
Movie Recommendation engines we looked at many different articles on the topic. Next we began 
to study the r packages manuals. In particular, we spent a great deal of time studying the recommenderlab
package. Through the different articles and manuals we explored how to preprocess data, visualize data, 
fit many models, hyper parameter
 optimization, cross-validation, model comparison, ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, 
 and compare with random selection. 
 Furthermore, we deployed a shiny app to where you can add data (rate some movies)
 and play with the different types of models (only the best models were included).

Note the web app seems to a bit more buggy but running on a local device works perfectly.

This project was a fun challenge and I am grateful for Dr. Zhou's guidance
